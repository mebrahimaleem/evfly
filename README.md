We achieve sim-to-real transfer of event-vision robot control policies by leveraging depth prediction as a pretext task that be tuned in a post-training phase. We demonstrate flight indoor & outdoor, in dark and lighted conditions, at speeds of 1-5m/s, with two different event cameras.

## Introduction

This is the official repository for the paper "Monocular Event-Based Vision for Obstacle Avoidance with a Quadrotor" by Bhattacharya, et al. (2024) from [GRASP, Penn](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu) and [RPG, UZH](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/). Please note that this repository contains research-grade code and a typical user may come across some legacy and messy code.

We present the first static-obstacle avoidance method for quadrotors using just an onboard, monocular event camera. Quadrotors are capable of fast and agile flight in cluttered environments when piloted manually, but vision-based autonomous flight in unknown environments is difficult in part due to the sensor limitations of traditional onboard cameras. Event cameras, however, promise nearly zero motion blur and high dynamic range, but produce a large volume of events under significant ego-motion and further lack a continuous-time sensor model in simulation, making direct sim-to-real transfer not possible.

By leveraging depth prediction as a pretext task in our learning framework, we can pre-train a reactive obstacle avoidance events-to-control policy with approximated, simulated events and then fine-tune the perception component with limited events-and-depth real-world data to achieve obstacle avoidance in indoor and outdoor settings.

We demonstrate this across two quadrotor-event camera platforms in multiple settings and find, contrary to traditional vision-based works, that low speeds (1m/s) make the task harder and more prone to collisions, while high speeds (5m/s) result in better event-based depth estimation and avoidance. We also find that success rates in outdoor scenes can be significantly higher than in certain indoor scenes.

## Simulator installation

Note that if you'd only like to train models, and *not* run the Flightmare simulation to test models in simulation, you can simply clone this repository and skip straight to section [Train](#train).

<details>
<summary><strong>(optional) Set up a catkin workspace</strong></summary>

If you'd like to start a *new* catkin workspace, then a typical workflow is (note that this code has only been tested with ROS Noetic and Ubuntu 20.04):
```
cd
mkdir -p evfly_ws/src
cd evfly_ws
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO
catkin config --merge-devel
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fdiagnostics-color
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Clone this repository and set up</strong></summary>

Once inside your desired workspace, clone this repository:
```
cd ~/evfly_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:anish-bhattacharya/evfly
cd evfly
```

In order to replicate the Unity obstacle environment used for training and (sim) testing, you will need to download `simulation/custom_sim_forest_environment.tar` (5.5MB) from [Datashare](https://upenn.app.box.com/v/evfly-grasp-rpg) and extract it to the right location (below). This contains 100 tree obstacle configurations.
```
tar -xvf <path/to/custom_sim_forest_environment.tar> -C flightmare/flightpy/configs/vision
```

You will also need to download our Unity resources and binaries. Download `simulation/flightrender.tar` (443MB) from [Datashare](https://upenn.app.box.com/v/evfly-grasp-rpg) and then:
```
tar -xvf <path/to/flightrender.tar> -C flightmare/flightrender --strip-components=1
```

Then, build the workspace:
```
bash setup_ros.bash
cd ../..
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/evfly
```

Note that you may have to install additional necessary packages, such as rqt_gui, opencv, libzmqpp-dev, and others. Also note you may include a `CATKIN_IGNORE` in the ROS packages `evfly_ros` and `evfly_dv_ros` so that you don't need to install event camera dependencies while just doing simulation or training work.

Please add the following lines to your .bashrc so you may run the simulation from any open shell:
```
export FLIGHTMARE_PATH=/path/to/evfly/flightmare
source ~/evfly_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

</details>

## Test (simulation)

As we describe in the paper, testing the model in real-time simulation necessitates estimating eventstreams via difference-of-log-images, which is out-of-distribution for the Vid2E-trained models. Therefore, do not expect high success rates in simulation test runs.

You'll likely need to install the following python packages if you haven't already:
```
tensorboard #if you don't set DEPLOYMENT = True in learner/learner.py
h5py
opencv
torch
torchvision
tqdm
imageio
configargparse
matplotlib
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Download pretrained weights</strong></summary>

Download `pretrained_models.tar` (174MB) from [Datashare](https://upenn.app.box.com/v/evfly-grasp-rpg). This tarball includes a number of simulation-pre-trained and real-fine-tuned models. For simulation testing in the provided forest environment, we will use the jointly-trained $D(\theta),V(\phi)$ model `sim_forest_DthetaVphi.pth`.
```
tar -xvf <path/to/pretrained_models.tar>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>(optional) Edit the config file</strong></summary>

*If you are just interested in the same forest environment we use in the paper, you should not need to edit the config file.*

Relevant notes for the `flightmare/flightpy/configs/vision/config.yaml` file:
- `level` specifies the environment type (we only provide `sim_forest_environment`) and `env_folder` specifies the environment index (`environment_<0-99>`).
- `datagen: 0` and `rollout: 1` runs trials in sequential environment indices starting from the given `env_folder`, and uses the `custom_` environment formulation we provide be pre-pending `custom_` to the specified `level`. This custom environment formulation describes static obstacles as dynamic ones so they can have updated positions every time the Unity environment is reset.
- `unity: scene: 2` specifies the warehouse environment with grassy ground texture and improved lighting on the trees. Other available scenes and their drone starting positions are found in `flightmare/flightpy/configs/scene.yaml`.

When running the simulation (the following section), you can set any number `N` of trials to run. To run trials on the same, specified environment index, set `datagen: 1` and `rollout: 0`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Run the simulation</strong></summary>

The `launch_evaluation.bash` script launches Flightmare and the trained model for event-based flight when using `vision` mode. To run trials:
```
bash launch_evaluation.bash <N> vision
```

Some details: If you look at the bash script, you'll see multiple python scripts being run. `envtest/ros/run_competition.py` subscribes to input images, computes approximated event batches, and passes them to the model to get desired velocity commands. It also selects the config file from which to load model parameters, currently set to `learner/configs/eval_config_sim_joint.txt` which utilizes the jointly-trained $D(\theta)$ and $V(\phi)$ model from simulation. `envtest/ros/evaluation_node.py` counts crashes, starts and aborts trials, and prints other statistics to the console. The topic `/debug_img1` streams images from the quadrotor grayscale camera and overlays approximate events on it in red-blue color. `/debug_img2` shows the model predicted depth reconstruction with an overlaid arrow indicating the model's output velocity command.

</details>

## Dataset generation (simulation)

To create a dataset of events, depth images, and desired velocity commands from execution of the privileged expert in simulation, we must first collect data from expert rollouts, then convert collected images into approximated events, and finally package the data into h5 file formats that our training script can read.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Run expert rollouts and collect data</strong></summary>

Ensure that the `flightmare/flightpy/configs/vision/config.yaml` parameters are unchanged. Default evaluation parameters specified in `envtest/ros/evaluation_config.yaml` resets the environment once the drone reaches the target `x=60`, the drone exits a specified bounding box, or the trial times out.

Run Flightmare in `state` mode to activate the privileged expert policy. Data will be stored upon each rollout in `envtest/ros/rollouts` (a folder created in the setup script):
```
bash launch_evaluation.bash <N> state
```

After populating the `rollouts` directory, you can move the relevant trajectory folders to your desired dataset directory. If copying all folders, make sure no previous, unwanted rollouts are present in the directory.
```
mv envtest/ros/rollouts/* data/datasets/new_dataset/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Run Vid2E to convert images to events (GPU installation of Vid2E required for now)</strong></summary>

Install [Vid2E](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_vid2e) then run the following script to approximate events from the collected images. Please note that the `--cpu` flag is legacy and not supported as of now. A numpy object array `evs_frames.npy` is created that contains a sequence of event frames for each trajectory in the dataset. Each event frame is a float array for all events within the time window between consecutive image frames, and contains the sum of positive and negative events at a given pixel location multiplied by the corresponding contrast thresholds (defaults values are +/-0.2).

```
python utils/to_events.py --dataset data/datasets/new_dataset --output_path data/datasets/new_dataset --acc_scheme time --keep_collisions
```

NOTE: If you struggle to install dependencies and run the above, I have included a sample conda `vid2e_environment.yml` that should include the packages necessary to run the above script. It is not minimal, and has many unnecessary packages, but you may try it: `conda env create -f vid2e_environment.yml`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. (optional) Package data into h5 files</strong></summary>

Our dataloader can read data from the format of trajectory folders+events npy file, but dataloading is faster when data is packaged into h5 files. To do this, run the following script to create a `new_dataset.h5` file that contains the events, depth images, and telemetry data for each trajectory in the dataset.
```
python utils/to_h5.py /absolute/path/to/new_dataset convert False
```
You can confirm the contents of the h5 file by running:
```
python utils/to_h5.py /absolute/path/to/new_dataset view False
```

</details>

## Dataset generation (real-world)

The post-training phase that fine-tunes the $D(\theta)$ model with real-world event camera data relies on a calibrated event camera-depth camera pair. We provide scripts to collect data, time-synchronize event batches with depth images, align them, and form a dataset.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Calibrate event camera and depth camera</strong></summary>

In our work, we use a Intel Realsense D435 depth camera with either a Prophesee Gen3 or DAVIS 346 event camera. The D435 depth images are pre-aligned with the infrared1 camera feed, which we can therefore use for calibration. In order to calibrate to the event camera, we use the e2calib procedure, including conversion of events to approximated grayscale images. Note that we utilize ROS1, e2vid, and Kalibr for the calibration process.

Record a chessboard/aprilboard sequence via `rosbag record` with the D435 and the event camera, recording the infrared1 feed and events. The relevant launch file is `data_gather/launch/events_and_d435.launch`, and you may use the bagging script `data_gather/bag_evs_d435_calib.sh`. We recommend holding the dual-camera setup still and moving the chessboard in front of it. Due to the events->images step later, you must start recording data with the board fully covering the event camera field of view then slowly back up and move the board around for collection.
- D435: Ensure that you are recording the D435 infrared images by setting the argument `enable_infra` to true in its launch file. When you use librealsense and ROS1 to run the camera you should see that `/camera/infra1/image_rect_raw` is aligned to `/camera/depth/image_rect_raw`.
- Event camera: Make sure that your event camera is focused properly and also publishing an eventstream. In our experience, the DAVIS ROS1 packages [dv-ros](https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/dv-ros) or [rpg_dvs_ros](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros) or Prophesee Metavision ROS1 package [by Bernd Pfrommer](https://github.com/ros-event-camera/metavision_driver) were fast enough to perform approximate time-synchronization with the D435. With the [Prophesee-provided package](https://github.com/prophesee-ai/prophesee_ros_wrapper) we observed a small lag making it unusable for calibration. Note that if using a non-DVS rosmsg type (e.g. if you use Bernd's driver), you must first convert the rosbag to have event messages in DVS message type before continuing with the calibration process. You can do this using the script `data_gather/rosbag_metavision-ros-driver_to_DVSmsgs.py`, which requires Bernd's package [`event_camera_py`](https://github.com/ros-event-camera/event_camera_py) as well as RPG Lab's `dvs_msgs`(https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros):

<details>
<summary>Using the event msg conversion script</summary>

Instructions for installing event_camera_py for ROS1 (full instructions including ROS2 are [here](https://github.com/ros-event-camera/event_camera_py)):
```
cd ~/evfly_ws/src
repo=event_camera_py
url=https://github.com/ros-event-camera/${repo}.git
git clone ${url}
[ -f ${repo}/${repo}.repos ] && vcs import < ${repo}/${repo}.repos ; cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO}
catkin build event_camera_py
```

Install dvs_msgs for ROS1:
```
cd ~/evfly_ws/src
repo=dvs_msgs
url=https://github.com/uzh-rpg/${repo}.git
git clone ${url}
catkin build dvs_msgs
```

Make sure you source the workspace before running the conversion script:
```
source ~/evfly_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Then run the conversion script:
```
python data_gather/rosbag_metavision-ros-driver_to_DVSmsgs.py /path/to/rosbag.bag /path/to/dvs_msgs_rosbag.bag
```
</details>

Next, we need to extract the images and their timestamps from the rosbag. Note that you will need to source a ros installation for this to work (`source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash` or `source /path/to/evfly_ws/devel/setup.bash`) or use the conda environment provided in `data_gather/environment.yml`.
```
python data_gather/ims_from_rosbag.py \
    /path/to/dvs_msgs_rosbag.bag \
    /path/to/output/bag_images \
    /optional/topic/name
```

Then, use e2calib to convert the events data to h5 format:
```
git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/e2calib.git
python e2calib/python/convert.py \
    /path/to/dvs_msgs_rosbag.bag \
    -o /path/to/output/events.h5 \
    -t /capture_node/events
```

Then, run image reconstruction from the events:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU_ID> python e2calib/python/offline_reconstruction.py \
    --h5file /path/to/output/events.h5 \
    --height 480 \
    --width 640 \
    --timestamps_file /path/to/output/bag_images/timestamps.txt \
    --output /path/to/output/reconstructions \
    --upsample_rate 1
```

Then, merge the reconstructions and bag_images into a new rosbag:
```
python data_gather/images_to_bags.py \
    --image_folders /path/to/output/reconstructions \
                    /path/to/output/bag_images \
    --topics /cam0/image_raw /cam1/image_raw \
    --output_bag /path/to/output/kalibr_rosbag.bag
```

Finally, after installing [Kalibr multi-camera calibration](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/multiple-camera-calibration), enter the kalibr docker container:
```
bash data_gather/run_kalibr.sh /path/to/output # where kalibr_rosbag.bag is located
```
When inside the kalibr docker container, run the following commands to calibrate the cameras:
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun kalibr kalibr_calibrate_cameras \
    --bag /data/kalibr_rosbag.bag \
    --target /data/aprilboard.yaml \
    --models pinhole-radtan pinhole-radtan \
    --topics /cam0/image_raw /cam1/image_raw
```
This may take some time. If all goes well, calibration will be successful and txt, yaml, and pdf files will be generated with both cameras' parameters.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Gather in-situ depth images and events</strong></summary>

Now we may gather depth and events to fine-tune the $D(\theta)$ model. `data_gather` is a ROS1 package useful for data collection, which must be built:
```
cd /path/to/evfly_ws
catkin build data_gather
source devel/setup.bash
```
Launch the following to run nodes for an event camera and a D435 camera:
```
roslaunch data_gather events_and_d435.launch
```
Once both cameras are running, start the bagging script to collect the necessary data:
```
bash data_gather/bag_evs_d435.sh
```
We recommend gathering around 30 seconds of handheld data with a variety of motions (rolling/pitching/forward/backward/left/right/fast/slow).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Align and package data</strong></summary>

Depending on the size of your rosbag file, you may want to splice the rosbag into smaller parts, which can then be treated as trajectories during the training process. We provide the following script to create smaller rosbags of length 10s each:
```
python data_gather/splice_rosbag.py /path/to/large/rosbag.bag /path/to/spliced/rosbags <rosbag length in seconds>
```
Next, run this bash script to extract data from each rosbag in a directory:
```
bash data_gather/data_from_rosbags.sh /path/to/spliced/rosbags data/datasets/new_dataset
```
Finally, run this script to run the necessary post-processing steps to align the events and depth images, and package the data into an h5 file. As in some previous scripts, you will need to adjust paths as necessary.
```
bash data_gather/prep-dataset.sh new_dataset
```
Now you should be able to use this h5 dataset file for training.

</details>

## Train

<details>
<summary><strong>(optional) Download a dataset</strong></summary>

We provide datasets for the simulated forest environment and the real forest environment presented in the paper. The corresponding h5 dataset files can be downloaded from the [Datashare](https://upenn.box.com/v/evfly-grasp-rpg) in the folder `datasets`. Please read the README for details on the provided datasets and the data format.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Train a model</strong></summary>

We provide a script `learner.py` that instantiates a Learner class, which can be used for loading models and datasets for purposes like model evaluation and data analysis, as well as training a new or pre-trained model. Training configuration is specified in the arguments in `learner/configs/config.txt`. Relevant files for debugging, as well as model checkpoints and tensorboard files are saved in the `learner/logs` directory. Note that we have only confirmed training functionality with a Nvidia GPU. To train:
```
python learner/learner.py --config learner/configs/config.txt
```

You can monitor training and validation statistics with Tensorboard:
```
tensorboard --logdir learner/logs
```

Please refer to the code to understand what each argument in the config file does. Some argument descriptions are in the later section "Useful config details for training or testing".

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Evaluate a model</strong></summary>

You can evaluate a model's performance for both depth prediction and velocity command prediction using the provided script `learner/evaluation_tools.py`. This script generates plots to compare ground truth vs. predicted velocity commands (valid for simulation only, where we have expert velocity commands) and a gif visualization of input events, predicted depth and velocity commands, and ground truth. These plots or visualizations are saved in the evaluation's workspace, saved in the `learner/logs` directory.

Sample snapshot from the gif visualization:

<img src="media/evalplotting-figure.png" width="347" height="260">

We provide sample commands with config files that assume pretrained models have been placed in the `evfly/data` directory.
For testing the joint $D(\theta)$-and-$V(\phi)$ model on the simulated forest dataset:
```
python learner/evaluation_tools.py --config learner/configs/eval_config_joint.txt
```
For testing the real forest deployment model that uses a ViT-LSTM model from [another work](https://github.com/anish-bhattacharya/ViT-for-quadrotor-obstacle-avoidance) for $V(\phi)$:
```
python learner/evaluation_tools.py --config learner/configs/eval_config_origunet_w_vitlstm.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Useful details for training or testing</strong></summary>

- You can train on multiple datasets by listing them in the dataset argument: `dataset = [real_forest-a, real_forest-b, real_forest-c, real_forest-d, real_forest-e]`.
- `evs_min_cutoff` specifies the bottom percentage threshold of events to cut out from event frames prior to feeding to the model. This helps cut out some of the high-texture events in real world trials, such as grass texture. For simulation datasets we keep this at 0 but for real datasets we typically set it to 0.15 (15%). You should not have to tune this parameter.
- `short=<N>` can be used to shorten the dataset size, typically for debugging purposes. Note that if you use small values like `short=5` then the `val_split=0.15` might lead to fewer than 2 validation trajectories, leading to errors in evaluation.
- To train or test a model from a given checkpoint, specify the path in the `checkpoint_path` argument in the config file.
- If you are training a model from a given checkpoint on the same dataset, and want to preserve the same train/val split, set `load_trainval = True`.
- During training, the argument `loss_weights = [10.0, 1.0]` specifies that the first loss parameter (velocity supervision MSE loss) is up-weighted by a factor of 10.0 and the second loss parameter (depth supervision MSE loss) is weighted by 1.0.
- During training, the argument `optional_loss_param = [5.0, -1.0]` specifically up-weights velocity prediction loss further by 5.0 where ground truth is executing a dodging maneuver (y- or z- command nonzero) and scales the depth prediction loss by the inverse depth values to up-weight the loss for closer objects.
- Note that the evaluation gif for a training example (with default parameters, one training and two validation gifs are generated) might exhibit data augmentation artifacts, like being left-right flipped.

</details>

## Real-world deployment

We provide a ROS1 package `evfly_ros` for running the trained models on an incoming event camera stream. This package does not provide an autopilot or flight controller, and is meant to be used in conjunction with a broader autonomy architecture (see [KumarRobotics Autonomous Flight](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_autonomous_flight), [RPG Agilicious](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/agilicious), [PX4](https://github.com/px4/px4-autopilot/), [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight)). To build the package, `catkin build evfly_ros` from the evfly_ws location (ensure you've removed any `CATKIN_IGNORE` file in the package). In the `run.py` script, you should modify the paths `EVFLY_PATH` and `CALIB_FILE`. Additionally, you need to modify the ROS topic names in the subscribers and publishers as appropriate. On a 12-core, 16GB RAM, cpu-only machine (similar to that used for hardware experiments presented in the paper) the model `OrigUNet_w_VITFLY_ViTLSTM` runs a forward pass in approximately 73ms.

Run your event camera driver (Prophesee), our C++ events processing node, and the model inference node with:
```
roslaunch evfly_ros evs_proc.launch
```
For DVS/DAVIS event cameras you may instead use:
```
roslaunch evfly_dv_ros dvs.launch
```

Model predicted depth and velocities, as well as the input events packaged into a frame, are published on the `/output` topics.

We include a `/trigger` signal that, when continuously published to, will route the predicted velocity commands to a given topic `/robot/cmd_vel`. We do this with the following terminal command typically sent from a basestation computer. If you Ctl+C this command, the rosnode will send velocity 0.0 commands to stop in place. This is a safety feature.
```
rostopic pub -r 50 /trigger std_msgs/Empty "{}"
```

Some details:
- Keep in mind the model is trained to continuously fly forward at the desired velocity and requires either manual pilot takeover  or reaching the positional guard limit to stop.
- z-velocity commands are currently set to maintain a given desired height set by `self.des_z`, and the p-gain used to do this may need slight tuning (line 306).
- We use a ramp-up in the `run()` function to smoothly accelerate the drone to the desired velocity over `self.ramp_duration` seconds.
- If you are using an event camera with resolution different than 260x346, then depending on the lens used for the event camera in relation to the depth camera intrinsics, you may want to either center-crop or just resize the batch of events to 260x346. This option is on lines 345-351.
- Velocity commands are published with respect to x-direction forward, y-direction left, and z-direction up.

Please fly safely!
